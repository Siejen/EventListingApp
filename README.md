#Community Events Listing App
App for members of the community to add and view a list of upcoming events.
	
##Overview
This app enables people to discover events within their community.

##Motivation
As someone who follows events in the tech industry, I find that there are a plethora of events on any given day.  However, the distribution of this information is generally poorly managed resulting in a lot of noise.  The motivation behind this app was to help the community discover curated events.

From the home page, members of the community could discover events within their community, and if someone wanted to add an event to the calendar, they would have to create a logon to add a new event posting.
